dotnet build BudgetCoach.sln
# Run individual services (example)
cd services/UserService/UserService.API
dotnet run
\`\`\`

### 5. Run Frontend

\`\`\`bash
cd frontend/web
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000

### 6. Access Services

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
